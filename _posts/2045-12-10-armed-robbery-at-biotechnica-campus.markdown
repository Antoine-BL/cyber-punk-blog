A daring armed robbery in the heart of the Biotechnical Campus lead to a vicious firefight and car chase which left 7 police and security guards injured. One of the robbers is also believed to have been injured in the shootout.

The target of the robbery seems to have been the Cloning Reference animals of the Biotechnical Designer Pets(tm) Labs on the campus. While there is evidence the lab's network was tampered with, most of Biotechnica's sensitive data was not breached. 

At the time of writing, no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, though unnamed sources in the NCPD believe the thieves to have been hired by the terrorist organization known as the Animal Liberation Front. 

The manhunt continues and it appears the NCPD has begun cracking down on traffic in and out of the city.
