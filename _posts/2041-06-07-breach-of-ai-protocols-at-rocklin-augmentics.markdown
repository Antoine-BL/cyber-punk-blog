Hey CHOOMBAS, Duel Murata here with another BOMBSHELL for you!

Yesterday, ex-Rocklin Augmentics designers Manuel Ferrera and Bianca Williams leaked documents that PROVE that they were pressured by management before they were FIRED weeks ago. The Man don't take no for an answer ammirite folks?

The designers say that approached them and DEMANDED they sign off on designs that were developed IN SECRET! Shady stuff!!1!

Acording to them, these SHADY designs wanted to achieve a "cyberware *gestalt*" (whatever the f*ck that means eh?) COMBINING Cyberware. 

There ya have it folks, The Man is at it again and breaking the 2025 A.I Protocols that "keep us safe" from all the so-called Rogues AIs. 

Yeah Right! I don't know what they're hiding in there, but it can't be good.

The conspiracy is real Chooms, and don't forget: 
*Just because you're paranoid, don't mean they're not after you*
