Hey CHOOMBAS, Nostradamus here with another BOMBSHELL for you!

Yesterday, an interview was published by media Duel Murata with ex-Rocklin Augmentics designers Manuel Ferrera and Bianca Williams which PROVES that they were pressured by management before they were FIRED weeks ago. The Man don't take no for an answer ammirite folks?

The designers say that Rocklin's HEAD HONCHOS approached them and DEMANDED they sign off on designs that were developed IN SECRET! Shady stuff!!1!

Acording to them, these SHADY designs wanted to achieve a "cyberware *gestalt* " (whatever the f*ck that means eh?) by COMBINING Cyberware from different people! 

There ya have it folks, The Man is at it again and breaking the 2025 A.I Protocols that "keep us safe" from all the so-called Rogues AIs. 

Yea Right! Dunno what they're HIDING in the Old Net, but it CANT be good.

The conspiracy is REAL Chooms, and don't forget: 
*Just because you're paranoid, don't mean they're not after you*
