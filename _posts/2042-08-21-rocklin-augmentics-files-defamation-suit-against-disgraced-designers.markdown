Rocklin Augmentics, the Texas-based cybernetics and structural enhancement giant, filed a defamation lawsuit against two former designers, Manuel Ferrara and Bianca Williams for false claims about the company's business activities.

Rocklin Augmentics is alleging that Ferrara and Williams "victimized Rocklin Augmentics by knowingly and deliberately spreading false information about the company's business activities, all in an effort to get revenge", the company's attorney, Harold Denton, said in a statement. The company is seeking unspecified damages for "loss of revenue and emotional distress of [its] employees".

The suit comes over a year after the two designers gave a bombshell interview last year alleging that Rocklin Augmentics was conducting illegal cyberware research in violation of the 2025 A.I. Protocols.

In response, the Corporate-backed Net Security force, NetWatch, launched an in-depth investigation which failed to corroborate the allegations and which cleared Rocklin Augmentics of all wrongdoing.
