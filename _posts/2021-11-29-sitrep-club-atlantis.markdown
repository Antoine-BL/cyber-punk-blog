- This month, as with most months, you're short on rent, and Doc Carver has a job for you.
- One of Carver's contacts has just acquired some "hot merch:" a microchip lifted from "some Corp or other". Carver is not sure what is on it, but they're sure "it's valuable".
- To offload this hot microchip, you are tasked to meet a local Fixer known as "Slice" who usually hangs out with his Choombas and working girls over at Club Atlantis.
- Pay is 500eb per runner.
- On the way to the Club, Pulse used his deduction skills to help Michi navigate the crew to avoid stumbling into the Combat Zone. (+10 IP)
- At the Club entrance, the crew attempted to leverage their Cool to enter the Club quickly and without drawing attention. Despite being "underdressed" for a Corpo Club in The Glen, Birdie was able to act the part and be allowed entry into the Club. (+10 IP)
- Not to be disarmed in case negotiations went south, the crew attempted to smuggle their firearms in despite strict "No Gun" policy. Despite her best efforts, Michi failed to fully conceal her SMG under her clothes. However, Birdie's quick thinking and smooth talkin' distracted the Bouncer and allowed them to gain entry without arousing suspicion. (+10 IP)
- Once in the Club, Vigo was able to talk the bartender into revealing the location of their target: Slice.
- Vigo and Michi stay back to keep an eye on things as Pulse and Birdie go to deal with Pulse. Once the exchange is made and payment rendered, Vigo and Michi spot Militech Security Operatives entering the club.
- The Club music stops, and the Operatives begin working through the Club looking for the microchip which contains classified schematics and blueprints for various Militech Weapons.
- Thinking quickly on his feet, Pulse notices an escape route through the Club offices, allowing the Party to escape quietly with Slice to ensure the transaction is successful while Vigo and Michi distract the Militech operatives. (+10 IP)
- Vigo used his excellent Netrunning skills to quickly locate the door code to the office, allowing his crew mates to escape and stayed behind not to arouse the suspicion of the Militech soldiers. (+20 IP)
- On the way back from the Club, the party is ambushed by Boosters from the Red Chrome Legion Hate Gang. Michi ruthlessly dispatched several gangers with the help of her trusty AK-80 and Pulse was able to quickly dispatch two gangers himself with quick, well aimed shots of his Armalite .44 Heavy Pistol. (+10 each)
